# ams-instrcontrol - Python code for conducting attenuation measurement
# This repository contains a few sample codes used to control electrical equipment like spectrum analyzer, signal generator, programmable attenuator, lock in amplifier etc. using PyVisa. A basic experiment was programmed to make sample attenuation measurement in a rudimentary way assuming the flow of the experiment.
